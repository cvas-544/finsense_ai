## 🧠 Key Architecture Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Goals | Built using the GAME framework (Goal → Actions → Memory → Env) |
| Tools | Actions are registered with schemas and decorators |
| Memory | Stores transaction history, summaries, and agent context |
| Environment | Executes tools safely and tracks context |
| Agent2Agent | Future-ready to communicate with other agents like InvestmentAgent |
| RDS Backend | All data stored in PostgreSQL on AWS RDS |
| Telegram UI | Bot interface for real-time queries and commands |
| EC2 Hosting | Deploy the CLI and tools API on AWS EC2 instance for persistent access |

## 🚫 Not In Scope (for now)
- Real-time bank syncing (uses manual PDFs)
- Currency conversion
- Investment tools (coming later)
- Visual dashboards (basic summaries only for now)

---

## 🛠 Future-Ready
This agent is designed to grow over time by:
- Adding new tools ("predict next month's spend")
- Registering new goals ("Save €200 for vacation")
- Adding richer interfaces (mobile, voice, etc.)
